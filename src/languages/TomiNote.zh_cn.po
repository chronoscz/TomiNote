"[Summary]\n"
"\n"
"The database engine used by this program is SQLite3, you need to install SQLite3 in order to use this program normally, or you can put the SQLite3 dynamic link library file (sqlite3.dll in Windows or libsqlite3.so in Linux) into the \"lib\" directory of the program's directory.\n"
"\n"
"All configuration information for this program is saved in the \".ini\" file with the same name as the program, you can delete the configuration file to make the program restore the default settings, configuration file and program file are in the same directory.\n"
"\n"
"The size of all windows in this program are adjustable, the font name and font size of all windows are also adjustable, if you are not satisfied with the default interface, you can manually adjust them, the adjusted state will be saved in the configuration file.\n"
"\n"
"This program uses dynamic load node, when you open the database, it will not load all the nodes, only the first depth node is loaded, when you expand a node, it will load its next node, so you don't have to worry about loading too much data too slow, but the count of nodes should not exceed 2147483640, which is determined by the type of integer used by the program, you can modify the source code to make it support more The number of nodes, but also consume more database space.\n"
"\n"
"You can use the command line parameter --c or --config to specify the directory of the configuration file, such as: TomiNote --config=~/.config/TomiNote\n"
"\n"
"You can use the command line parameter --l or --lang to specify the directory of the language files, such as: TomiNote --lang=/usr/share/TomiNote/languages\n"

"You can search for text in node name and node content. You can search for text in \"Selected node\" or \"Selected node and its descendants\" or \"All nodes\".\n"
"\n"
"Carriage returns and newline characters in search content and replacements will be converted to \\r \\n, tabs will be converted to \\t, backslashes will be converted to \\\\, and if the search content or replacement contains With \\r \\n \\t \\\\, the backslash in these symbols will not be converted.\n"
"\n"
"The search results will be listed in the InfoBar, which you can double-click to jump to the corresponding place of the search result.\n"
"\n"
"You can also replace text, replacement results will be listed in the InfoBar, you can use regular expressions in the replace operation.\n"
"\n"

"\n"
"本程序使用 SQLite3 作为数据库引擎，你需要安装 SQLite3 才能正常使用本程序，或者你也可以把 SQLite3 的动态链接库文件（在 Windows 中是 sqlite3.dll，在 Linux 中是 libsqlite3.so）放到本程序所在目录中的“lib”目录中即可。\n"
"\n"
"本程序的所有配置信息都存放在与本程序同名的“.ini”文件中，你可以删除配置文件以恢复程序的默认设置。配置文件与本程序在同一目录中。\n"
"\n"
"本程序中的所有窗口都可以调整大小，窗口的字体名称和字体大小也都可以调整，如果你对默认界面不满意，你可以手动调整它们，调整后的状态信息将会保存在配置文件中。\n"
"\n"
"本程序使用动态载入节点的方式，当打开数据库时，并不会载入所有节点，只会载入第一层节点，当你展开某个节点时，才会载入它的下一级节点，所以你不必担心数据太多造成加载太慢，但是你的节点数量不应该超过 2147483640 个，这是本程序所使用的整数类型所决定的，你可以修改本程序源代码使它支持更多的节点数量，但同时也会占用更多的数据库空间。\n"
"\n"
"你可以使用命令行参数 --c 或 --config 来指定配置文件的存放目录，例如：--config=~/.config/TomiNote\n"
"\n"
"你可以使用命令行参数 --l 或 --lang 来指定语言文件的存放目录，例如：--lang=/usr/share/TomiNote/languages\n"

"自动备份功能会每分钟检查一次剩余时间，如果剩余时间为 0，则执行自动备份，并将剩余时间复位。\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"[历史记录]\n"
"\n"
"历史记录只支持 Ctrl + V 的粘贴方式，或通过菜单进行粘贴，不支持其它粘贴方式，否则历史记录会出错。\n"
"\n"
"你可以只保留当前节点的历史记录，也可以保留所有节点的历史记录，可以在选项对话框中进行切换。\n"
"\n"
"你可以在选项对话框中限制单个节点的“历史记录最大容量”和“历史记录最少数量”，如果设置为 0，则表示没有限制。\n"

"\n"
"搜索内容和替换内容中的回车符和换行符将被转换为 \\r \\n，制表符将被转换为 \\t，反斜线将被转换为 \\\\，如果搜索内容或替换内容中包含有 \\r \\n \\t \\\\，则这些符号中的反斜线不会被转换。\n"
"\n"
"搜索结果将在信息栏列出，你可以双击信息栏中的条目以跳转到搜索结果的相应位置。\n"
"\n"
"你也可以替换文本，替换结果将在信息栏列出，你可以在替换操作中使用正则表达式。\n"
"\n"
"在输入“搜索内容”或“替换内容”后，可以通过 Ctrl + 回车 来执行搜索或替换操作。\n"
"\n"
"注意：正则表达式仅支持 Unicode UCS-2 范围内的字符。\n"
"\n"
"注意：执行了多节点替换操作的节点将丢失其历史记录。\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"[导入和导出]\n"
"\n"
"你可以从“文本文件”或“目录”或“数据库文件”中导入数据到当前数据库，你也可以将当前数据库中的节点或树导出到“文本文件”或“目录”或“数据库文件”中。\n"
"\n"
"“另存为”操作是使用“导出到数据库”功能实现的。“导出到数据库”功能会压缩数据库中的零碎空间。\n"
"\n"
"如果你将数据导出到一个已存在的数据库文件中，则目标文件中的原始数据不会被覆盖，新的数据将被追加到目标文件的尾部。\n"
"\n"
"注意：“另存为”操作将会首先删除目标文件，而不会保留目标文件中的数据。\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"[字体名称和字体大小]\n"
"\n"
"你可以在选项对话框中设置“字体名称”和“字体大小”，如果字体名称设置为空，则表示使用系统默认字体，如果字体大小设置为 0，则表示使用系统默认字体大小。\n"

"\n"
"在关闭目录树的情况下，你可以使用 Ctrl + PageUp 和 Ctrl + PageDown 来切换节点进行浏览。\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"[节点工具]\n"
"\n"
"在节点工具集中，排序工具可以对同级节点或子节点进行排序，拆分工具可以将笔记拆分成多个子节点。\n"
"\n"
"拆分工具中的“分隔符”是用来拆分笔记的符号，使用正则表达式语法，本程序会在笔记中搜索该分隔符，然后将分隔符前后的文本拆分成两部分，分别存入不同的子节点中。“标题”也使用正则表达式语法，本程序会在拆分后的内容中搜索标题字符串，找到后，会将该字符串作为子节点的标题使用。如果选中“包含分隔符”选项，则分隔符字符串会被包含在拆分后的文本中，否则不会包含，如果选中“添加前缀数字”选项，则会在子节点标题的前面添加数字序号，数字的个数在后面的编辑框中指定，如果选中“添加后缀数字”选项，则会在子节点标题的后面添加数字序号，数字的个数在后面的编辑框中指定。\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"[文本工具]\n"
"\n"
"在文本工具集中，脚本工具可以对文本进行连续多次的替换操作。\n"
"\n"
"在脚本工具中，左边的编辑框可以用来输入脚本名称，输入完毕后，点击“添加”按钮就可以添加一个脚本，然后就可以在右边的编辑框中输入脚本内容，脚本内容很简单，就是两行内容的重复，一行是要搜索的内容，一行是要替换的内容，这里要求使用正则表达式，搜索的内容必须以 sch= 开头，替换的内容必须以 rep= 开头，这样的两行内容可以重复多次，例如：\n"
"\n"
"sch=([0-9])([a-zA-Z])\n"
"rep=$1 $2\n"
"\n"
"sch=([a-zA-Z])([0-9])\n"
"rep=$1 $2\n"
"\n"
"这样就可以实现在所有字母和数字之间添加一个空格。输入完毕后，在节点树中选择一个要执行替换操作的节点，然后点击“执行”按钮，就开始执行替换操作了。“添加”按钮后面是“删除”按钮，“删除”按钮后面是“修改”按钮，“修改”按钮可以用来修改脚本名称。\n"

"转义字符：（如果给不需要转义的字符前添加 \\ 字符, 则会忽略 \\ 字符）\n"
"\n"
"\\x\n"
"　　匹配 ASCII 字符，后面必须紧跟 1-2 位十六进制 ASCII 码。\\x 后面最好跟两位十六进制 ASCII 码，不够两位的前面补 0，这样后面就可以再跟其它数字了（或者，如果你只有一个子表达式，而你却用 \\12 来引用，那什么后面的 2 将被直接当做字符 '2' 处理）。\n"
"\n"
"\\nnn\n"
"　　匹配 ASCII 字符，后面必须为 3 位八进制 ASCII 码。\n"
"\n"
"\\r\n"
"　　回车符\n"

"\n"
"------------------------------\n"
"\n"
"功能字符：\n"
"\n"
"|\n"
"　　前后两者选一\n"
"\n"
"+\n"
"　　重复 1 次或多次\n"
"\n"
"*\n"
"　　重复 0 次或多次\n"

"{n,m}\n"
"　　重复 n 至 m 次\n"
"\n"
"{n,}\n"
"　　重复 n 次或多次\n"
"\n"
"[-]\n"
"　　范围匹配，其中的 - 符号，在连接特殊字符的情况下，仅表示 - 符号自身。比如 \\w-z 只表示三个字符。\n"
"\n"
"[^]\n"
"　　范围外匹配\n"
"\n"
"\\d\n"
"　　匹配所有数字，相当于 [0-9]\n"
"\n"
"\\D\n"
"　　匹配所有非数字，相当于 [^0-9]\n"
"\n"
"\\w\n"
"　　匹配字母、数字、下划线，相当于 [A-Za-z0-9_]\n"
"\n"
"\\W\n"
"　　匹配非字母、数字、下划线，相当于 [^A-Za-z0-9_]\n"

"\n"
"m\n"
"　　多行模式; 它只是修改了 ^(行首) 和 $(行尾)的意义\n"
"\n"
"g\n"
"　　贪婪模式；\n"
"\n"
"s\n"
"　　单行模式; 它只是修改了 . 的意义, 使用后 . 也可以匹配换行符\n"
"\n"
"x\n"
"　　两个意思: 1、排除非转义空白; 2、启用 # 后面的注释。\n"
"\n"
"------------------------------\n"
"\n"
"字符在 [] 中使用时的特殊情况：\n"
"\n"
"|+*?.\n"
"　　这些字符在 [] 只能表示该字符本身\n"

"　　这些转义字符在 [] 中都可以正常转义，其中 \\b 是退格符\n"
"\n"
"\\-[]\n"
"　　这些字符用在 [] 中时，需要转义，也就是说要写成 \\\\ \\- \\[ \\]。当 - 不在两个 ASCII 字符之间时，不需要写成 \\-，比如 [\\w-z]、[abc-]、[a-\\s]\n"
