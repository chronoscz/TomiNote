"[Summary]\n"
"\n"
"The database engine used by this program is SQLite3, you need to install SQLite3 in order to use this program normally, or you can put the SQLite3 dynamic link library file (sqlite3.dll in Windows or libsqlite3.so in Linux) into the \"lib\" directory of the program's directory.\n"
"\n"
"All configuration information for this program is saved in the \".ini\" file with the same name as the program, you can delete the configuration file to make the program restore the default settings, configuration file and program file are in the same directory.\n"
"\n"
"The size of all windows in this program are adjustable, the font name and font size of all windows are also adjustable, if you are not satisfied with the default interface, you can manually adjust them, the adjusted state will be saved in the configuration file.\n"
"\n"
"This program uses dynamic load node, when you open the database, it will not load all the nodes, only the first depth node is loaded, when you expand a node, it will load its next node, so you don't have to worry about loading too much data too slow, but the count of nodes should not exceed 2147483640, which is determined by the type of integer used by the program, you can modify the source code to make it support more The number of nodes, but also consume more database space.\n"
"\n"
"You can use the command line parameter --c or --config to specify the path of the configuration file, such as: TomiNote --config=~/.config/TomiNote/TomiNote.ini\n"
"\n"
"You can use the command line parameter --l or --lang to specify the directory of the language files, such as TomiNote --lang=/usr/share/TomiNote/languages\n"

"\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"[Auto Save]\n"
"\n"

"\n"
"You can check the \"Auto Save\" Timer remaining time in the Options dialog box and you can modify it.\n"
"\n"
"The \"Auto Save\" function checks the remaining time every minute, and if the remaining time is 0, \"Auto Save\" is performed and the remaining time is reset.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"[Auto Backup]\n"
"\n"
"The \"Auto Backup\" Timer will start after the first time save the file. If you never saved the file after last backup, the \"Auto Backup\" Timer will not start.\n"
"\n"
"You can change the \"Auto Backup\" Timer interval in the Options dialog box. If set to 0, \"Auto Backup\" is disabled.\n"
"\n"
"You can change the maximum count of \"Auto Backup\" files in the Options dialog box. If set to 0, \"Auto Backup\" is disabled.\n"
"\n"
"You can check the \"Auto Backup\" Timer remaining time in the Options dialog box and you can modify it. The remaining time for \"Auto Backup\" is stored in the database.\n"
"\n"
"The \"Auto Backup\" function checks the remaining time every minute, and if the remaining time is 0, \"Auto Backup\" is performed and the remaining time is reset.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"[History Record]\n"
"\n"
"History only supports Ctrl + V paste, or paste through the menu, do not support other paste, or history will be wrong.\n"
"\n"
"You can keep the history of the current node, or you can keep the history of all nodes, you can switch it in the Options dialog box.\n"
"\n"
"You can limit the maximum capacity and minimum count of single node's history in the Options dialog box. If you set it to 0, there is no limit.\n"
"\n"
"You can discard the history to free up memory, which you can do in the Options dialog box.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"[Search And Replace]\n"
"\n"
"You can search for text in node name and node content. You can search for text in \"Selected node\" or \"Selected node and its descendants\" or \"All nodes\".\n"
"\n"
"Carriage returns and newline characters in search content and replacements will be converted to \\r \\n, tabs will be converted to \\t, backslashes will be converted to \\\\, and if the search content or replacement contains With \\r \\n \\t \\\\, the backslash in these symbols will not be converted.\n"
"\n"
"The search results will be listed in the InfoBar, which you can double-click to jump to the corresponding place of the search result.\n"
"\n"
"You can also replace text, replacement results will be listed in the InfoBar, you can use regular expressions in the replace operation.\n"
"\n"
"After you enter \"search content\" or \"replace content\", you can use Ctrl + Enter to perform Search or Replace operation.\n"
"\n"
"Note: Regular expressions support only characters within the range of Unicode UCS-2.\n"
"\n"
"Note: The nodes that executed the multi-node replace operation will lose their history.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"[Import And Export]\n"

"\n"
"The \"Save As\" operation is implemented using the \"Export To Database\" function. The \"Export To Database\" function will compress the fragmented space in the database.\n"
"\n"
"If you export the data to an existing database file, the original data in the target file will not be overwritten, and the new data will be appended to the end of the target file.\n"
"\n"
"Note: The \"Save As\" operation will delete the target file first, without retaining the data in the target file.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"[Font Name And Font Size]\n"
"\n"
"You can set the font name and font size in the Options dialog box, if the font name set is empty, the system default font is used, if the font size is set to 0, the system default font size is used.\n"
"\n"
"You can also use Ctrl + MouseWheel to adjust the font size.\n"
"\n"

"\n"
"\n"
"[Node Utils]\n"
"\n"
"In the Node Utils, Sort tool can sort sibling nodes or subnodes, and Split tool can split one note into multiple subnodes.\n"
"\n"
"In the Split tool, the \"Separator\" is the symbol that used to split the note, it use the regular expression syntax, the program will search for the sparator in the note, then split the text before and after the separator into two parts, then save them to the different child nodes. the \"Title\" is also use the regular expression syntax, the program will search the Title string in the splitted text, then the string will be used as the name of the child node. If the \"Include Separator\" option is checked, the separator string will be include in the splitted text, otherwise it will not be include. If the \"Add Prefix Number\" option is checked, a serial number will be added to the beginning of the subnode name, the length of the number is specified in the edit box which follow the option. If the \"Add Suffix Number\" option is checked, a serial numbers will be added to the ending of the subnode name, the length of the number is specified in the edit box which follow the option.\n"
"\n"

"\n"
"sch=([0-9])([a-zA-Z])\n"
"rep=$1 $2\n"
"\n"
"sch=([a-zA-Z])([0-9])\n"
"rep=$1 $2\n"
"\n"
"This script will add a space between all letters and numbers. After input, select a node in the node tree that need to perform the replacement operation, and then click the \"Execute\" button, it will start the replacement operation. The \"Add\" button is followed by the \"Delete\" button, the \"Delete\" button is followed by the \"Modify\" button, the \"Modify\" button can be used to modify the script name.\n"
